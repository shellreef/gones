Mostly about falling through holes

from smbdis.asm:
3179 PlayerHole:lda Player_Y_HighPos[b5]    ;check player's vertical high byte
317b            cmp #$02                    ;for below the screen
PAYUGP act as if died immediately on level start: play music, no scrolling, but you're stuck on the same screen
317c:01 cmp #$01
317c:03, 04 still die if fall down hole just takes longer
                bmi ExitCtrl                ;branch to leave if not that far down
317f            ldx #$01
{AEALAP} can still scroll the screen after you die falling down a hole (disable scroll lock)
3180:00 ldx #$00

3181            stx ScrollLock[0723]        ;set scroll lock
{SUALZP + AEALLP} fall from top of screen when falling down holes, and keep playing (without music) - but dying by enemy hit loops forever - use with an invincibility code
SUALZP 3182:b5 STX #$xxb5
AEALLP 3183:00 STX #$00xx
store #$01 in Player_Y_HighPos
try to store #$01 in Player_Y_HighPos, but hangs
shorter version of PEALIP + SUALYP + AEALAP

3184            ldy #$04
3186            sty $07                     ;set value here

{PEALIP + SUALYP + AEALAP} fall from top of screen when falling down holes, and keep playing (without music)
PEALIP + SUALYP fall from top of screen when falling down hole - but disables scroll lock so can't keep playing (fixed above)
PEALIP 3185:01 LDY #$01
SUALYP 3187:b5 STY Player_Y_HighPos
still plays music when falling down, and stops playing music after
AVAUAP 3188:60 RTS (+ above) don't affect music when falling down, but still disables scroll lock so can't keep playing

note: http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=5&gid=905 has an existing code:
"Falling Doesn't Kill You       OKNLOYIV        You just appear from above. Be warned that you won't be able to get out of the cloud bonus      megaman_exe"
it works similarly - but doesn't interrupt music. what about cloud bonus?

                ldx #$00                    ;use X as flag, and clear for cloud level
                ldy GameTimerExpiredFlag    ;check game timer expiration flag
318d            bne HoleDie                 ;if set, branch
AVAUIP do not die when falling down a hole (but you can't continue playing either)
318d:60 RTS

318f            ldy CloudTypeOverride       ;check for cloud type override [coin/bonus level, I think]
KEAUYO no effect 318f:8c STY

3192            bne ChkHoleX                ;skip to last part if found
ENPLZP go to coin level when die - not a good code, still gets stuck on level 1-2 in bricks
3192:f0 BEQ

3194 HoleDie:   inx                         ;set flag in X for player death
OEPLGO go to underground coin world when falling down hole instead of dying
3194:89 INX+LDY -> DOP #$A4 + ASL $0BC0 (nops out the GameEngineSubroutine call)
works well on level 1-1, but on level 1-2 you get stuck in the wall - better code see ZELLYP

                ldy GameEngineSubroutine[0E]
3197            cpy #$0b                    ;check for some other routine running [PlayerDeath]
AEPUAP no effect 3198:00

3199            beq ChkHoleX                ;if so, branch ahead
{ESPUPP} fast restart when dying by falling down a hole (no death music and no wait)
sound effect plays twice when getting hit by an enemy
3199:f0 BNE
                ldy DeathMusicLoaded[0712]  ;check value here
319e            bne HoleBottom              ;if already set, branch to next part
ENPUTP 319e:d0 BEQ

31a0            iny
EEZLAO play end-of-game music forever when dying falling down a hole
31a0:88 DEY
                sty EventMusicQueue[FC]     ;otherwise play death music
KSZLAO no death music when falling down hole, although it still waits a while (better is ESPUPP)
31a0:dc TOP

                sty DeathMusicLoaded        ;and set value here
    HoleBottom: ldy #$06
                sty $07                     ;change value here
    ChkHoleX:   cmp $07                     ;compare vertical high byte with value set here
                bmi ExitCtrl                ;if less, branch to leave
                dex                         ;otherwise decrement flag in X
                bmi CloudExit               ;if flag was clear, branch to set modes and other values
                ldy EventMusicBuffer        ;check to see if music is still playing
                bne ExitCtrl                ;branch to leave if so
317b            lda #$06                    ;otherwise set to run lose life routine [PlayerLoseLife]

IELLYP glitch into playing end level routine, and jerkily scrolling, when die falling down a hole. scrolls past flagpole
31b7:05 PlayerEndLevel

PELLYP when fall down hole and die, go to coin world and climb up vine (gets stuck in bricks at level 1-1)
31b7:01 Vine_AutoClimb

{ZELLYP} don't die when falling down a hole - instead, come up as if in a pipe (in coin world/shortcut if applicable) + infinite lives
31b7:02 SideExitPipeEntry
works better than OEPLGO, doesn't get stuck on levels 1-1 or 1-2, and no loss of life
death music still plays, but the game continues, with your current timer. 
this is a good code - makes the game much easier, and is not very glitchy
when dying in castles, jump to get out of the bricks
unfortunately, appears to hang after dying on world 4
and don't let your time run out
