This is the most in-depth information on the codes, including categories and notes,
not available elsewhere, but it does not include the code updates.

Analysis
TODO: first, classify all the codes by their official category from the codebook,
and save in a computer-readable format. There are some complexities here:
1. need to manually categorize codes from visual inspection of photographs (easy, but tedious)
2. multiple codes ("GOEANKAO + USEEEKKA") per effect, must be supported
3. alternate codes "YESUAPTE / YESLPPTE"
3a. find alternate versions, and tag codes by hash of ROM that they are expected to work on
 i.e., PRG0 or PRG1 (+hash), along with name
4. decode all codes
5. find ROM offset of all codes
6. disassemble and show instruction(s) modified
6a. can start at different offsets, so can guess to find out, but execution is most reliable
