all-nev.csv - comprehensive list of all 5244 official codes across all 481 games
    all official NES Game Genie codes in one place for the first time ever!


nev9.txt - *almost* official codebook, 481 games, from http://www.gshi.org/ugetab/RoughGenie/gg_nes.html
 but it has errors, missing 22 codes - see below

Files from http://www.nesworld.com/genie.php:
nev8.txt - codebook released online by Galoob (1994), 456 games. No game introduction text. Missing 25 games.
 Despite the comments on http://www.nesworld.com/genie.php, this is not the final version
neup01.txt - update volume 1 #1 (1993)
neup02.txt - update volume 1 #2
neup03.txt - update volume 1 #3 
neup04.txt - update volume 1 #4 
neup05.txt - update volume 2 #1 
necd5.txt  - update volume 2 #2 
neup07.txt - update volume 2 #3 
neup08.txt - update volume 2 #4
None of these show the category for each code.

GSHI
http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&pp=all has codes clearly in the official manual, 
but which are not in http://www.gshi.org/ugetab/RoughGenie/gg_nes.html (aka "nev9.txt"):
20	Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade(tm) Game http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2099 has 27 codes, but nev9 only 7 --  missing 20 in neup08.txt, not nev9
1       Star Trek: The Next Generation(tm) Game http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2280 ATETISVT Stop game time ticking over - missing 1 in neup08.txt, not nev9
1	Star Wars(tm) Game      http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2285 - transcription error? not in nev8/nev9/* code #4 Infinite lives  SZEAYXVK
total: 22 codes missing from nev9, added to all-nev.csv

But...
http://www.gshi.org/official_codes.html claims 5261 codes among 478 games for NES Game Gnenie
http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&m=h&sys=21 claims 5250 codes and 477 games by Galoob, and one each by nobody (blank code)
http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&pp=all actually shows 5247 codes for 476 games
Galoob made codes for a total of 481 games, so some are missing

Also, codes are overcounted, for alternate versions of the games:
-1	Dragon Warrior II(tm) Game	http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2025 has a blank entry counted as a code
-11	Micro Machines(tm) The Official Video	http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2170 double-counted for two versions
-11	RC Pro Am(tm) Game	http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2226 double-counted for two versions
-7	The Simpsons(tm): Bart(tm) vs. The Space Mutants Game http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2257 double-count for two versions
-5	Super Mario Bros.(tm) 2 Game http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2296 double-count two versions
-13	Ultimate Stuntman(tm) Game http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2296 double-count two versions
total: -48

which brings the actual total of Galoob's codes on GSHI down to 5199

Missing games, not on gshi at all:
7	1942(tm) Game
7	1943(tm) Game
4	Godzilla(tm) Game
4	WWF Wrestlemania Challenge(tm) Game	not to be confused with WWF Wrestlemania(tm) Game
Missing codes, the game is there but not the code on gshi:
3	Bonk's Adventure(tm) Game	http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=1953 all world warp codes
1	Bubble Bobble II(tm) Game	http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=1960 PEXEEALA        1 life--player 1
4	Double Dragon II: The Revenge(tm) Game	http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2019 all level warp codes
5	The Little Mermaid(tm) Game		http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2144 level warps missing
4	Roadblasters(tm) Game	http://www.gshi.org/?s=v2&sys=21&gid=2232 missing start with codes
6	T & C Surf Designs(tm)	not to be confused with T & C Surf 2: Thrilla's Safari(tm)
total: 45 missing official codes not on GSHI

It is missing: Rockin' Kats(tm) Game, Godzilla(tm) Game

This is the most in-depth information on the codes, including categories and notes,
not available elsewhere, but it does not include the code updates.

gamelist-gg.csv - listing all games Galoob made official Game Genie codes for, along 
    with the abbreviation used for the game (SMB3 etc.), which would almost
    be useful, but is not unique (MEGA is for multiple Mega Man games, and more).
    But this file is a comprehensive list of all GG games, easily parseable.
gamelist-goodnes314.csv - list of all games in "iMac:GoodNES 3.14 (Goodmerged by Xervils)"
gg2gn.csv - file mapping what Galoob calls each game to what GoodNES calls it
    Galoob sometimes doesn't use the full name of the game, and has superfluous
    (tm)s, and in one case a misspelling (Squoon should be Sqoon, easy mistake), so
    this file maps to the real names of the games for authoritive reference.


Analysis
TODO: first, classify all the codes by their official category from the codebook,
and save in a computer-readable format. There are some complexities here:
1. need to manually categorize codes from visual inspection of photographs (easy, but tedious)
2. multiple codes ("GOEANKAO + USEEEKKA") per effect, must be supported
3. alternate codes "YESUAPTE / YESLPPTE"
3a. find alternate versions, and tag codes by hash of ROM that they are expected to work on
 i.e., PRG0 or PRG1 (+hash), along with name
4. decode all codes
5. find ROM offset of all codes
6. disassemble and show instruction(s) modified
6a. can start at different offsets, so can guess to find out, but execution is most reliable
