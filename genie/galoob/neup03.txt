ARCH RIVALS(tm) GAME
OK, hoop fans, here's a few slam-dunk Game Genie(tm) codes to 
power up your game. The star code is definitely ARCH Code 4, which 
gives you faster speed when running left or right. 
For good defense, check out ARCH Code 3.
ARCH

BARBIE(tm) GAME
At last, you can complete all of the incredible Barbie(tm) dream 
adventures and go to the Fantasy Ball! Barbie usually starts with 
five Z's, and wakes up after all her Z's are gone. Try BARB Code 1 for 
infinite Z's! And usually, you can only re-enter Barbie's dream twice. 
With BARB Code 4, you can re-enter it as many times as you want! 
Or, if getting to the ball is getting a bit too easy for you, try BARB 
Code 3, which gives you only one Z, and BARB Code 5, which prevents 
you from re-entering the dream--when the Z's are gone, so is the 
game!
BARB
CODE    KEY IN . . .    EFFECT . . .
1       SXKSKNVK        Infinite Z's on Dream Meter
2       PEEZEZIE        Start with nine Z's on Dream Meter--1st credit 
only

4       SZVAAVVK        Can re-enter Barbie's dream an infinite 
number of times
5       AEEEYAZA        Cannot re-enter Barbie's dream

BATMAN: RETURN OF THE JOKER(tm) GAME
The Caped Crusader(tm) is back for another battle with the laughing 
lunatic of lawlessness, the Joker(tm). Use these codes to help you 
mow down the opposition on your march toward the Joker's lair. 
With JOKE Code 2, no life increments are lost when Batman(tm) runs 
into an enemy or when various objects hit him. The same goes for 
Code 3 when he falls into one of those "electric grid" areas. Codes 6, 
7 and 9 give you invincibility with fewer pick-ups of Backpack 
Energy Capsules(tm), and Code 8 lets you keep that invincibility 
until Batman dies or goes onto the next stage--instead of lasting for 
just a few moments. JOKE Codes 10 and 11 are for experts. JOKE 
Code 15, intense knock-back when hit, is a blast to play, but it can 
work to your disadvantage--you can sometimes hit a wall and get 
stuck or die!

BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT VIDEO GAME ADVENTURE(tm) GAME
Here are some truly excellent codes for this waycool game. With 
them, you can more easily restore order to the temporal continuum 
and have a most triumphant adventure. EXX Codes 1 through 4 work 
for Bill(tm) as well as Ted(tm). Use Code 1 and you'll never have to 
worry about getting out of jail again. Use Code 2 and you won't mind 
those clumsy locals bumping into you--they'll ask for a coin but it 
won't cost you anything. EXX Code 3 is most amazing! It gives you all 
the Good Stuff(tm) you could want, including Pudding Cups(tm), Big 
Boom Firecrackers(tm), Highly Dangerous Textbooks(tm), and 
Cassettes for your Boom Box. Throw as many as you want, because 
you'll always have a good supply. And in the Circuits of Time(tm), it 
usually costs 2 coins to let the phone booth complete a segment of 
the call.  EXX Code 4 cuts that cost in half.

BILL ELLIOTT'S NASCAR CHALLENGE(tm) GAME
Game Genie(tm) can give you just the edge you need to catch Bill 
Elliott(tm)! ELL Code 1 boosts your acceleration, but make sure you 
don't accelerate to full speed in the pit area, or it may take you 
longer to re-enter the race track. And normally you have 20 seconds 
of free time to choose the work you want done in the pits. ELL Code 2 
freezes the timer until you actually begin work. Finally, ELL Code 3 
stops the clock while your car is being worked on--but keep in mind 
that the race is still going, and you may still lose your position!

Ultima, Quest of the Avatar(tm) Game
Lots of codes to help you gain money, abilities and items in this 
challenging role-playing game. All AVA Codes that say "Start with" 
apply only to creating a character for a new game. When restarting 
an old game, you will still have whatever amount you left off with. 
For all 'cost nothing' codes, the cost shows up as 0. These codes 
work even when resuming a previous game. AVA Codes that give you 
extra points or magic will be ignored when you visit the King for 
level review--but are still useful for developing a good character 
early in the game.
