ADVENTURES OF LOLO 3(tm)
This latest sequel in the popular series is an excellent adventure 
with a puzzle challenge on every level. Use this powerful Game 
Genie(tm) code to help Lolo(tm) and Lala(tm) defeat the evil King!

BATMAN: RETURN OF THE JOKER(tm) GAME
The Caped Crusader(tm) is back for another battle with the laughing 
lunatic of lawlessness, the Joker(tm). Use these codes to help you mow 
down the opposition on your march toward the Joker's lair. With 
JOKE Code 2, no life increments are lost when Batman(tm) runs into an 
enemy or when various objects hit him. The same goes for Code 3 
when he falls into one of those "electric grid" areas. Codes 6, 7 and 
9 give you invincibility with fewer pick-ups of Backpack Energy 
Capsules(tm), and Code 8 lets you keep that invincibility until Batman 
dies or goes onto the next stage--instead of lasting for just a few 
moments. JOKE Codes 10 and 11 are for experts. JOKE Code 15, 
intense knock-back when hit, is a blast to play, but it can work to 
your disadvantage--you can sometimes hit a wall and get stuck or 
die!

FARIA(tm) GAME
Only you can save the King's daughter from the clutches of the evil 
wizard in this popular adventure game. If you think infinite energy, 
gold and magic would help, try FAR Codes 4 thru 7. When using Code 
5 for infinite gold, however, keep in mind that you must have enough 
gold to afford each purchase. With Code 1, the item screen will only 
show 30 arrows--but on the fight screen when you choose them, 250 
arrows will be displayed and counted down correctly.

ROGER CLEMENS' MVP BASEBALL(tm) GAME
One of the game's greatest pitchers has lent his name to one of the 
greatest baseball video games. There's an interesting fielder's-eye-
view perspective, and you can always call upon the star pitcher for 
advice. These Game Genie(tm) codes will give you a new perspective, 
too. Our advice is to try combining ROGER Codes 3 and 4 to get 
almost infinite strikes--strikes are still called on a foul ball, except 
on 3rd strike (but when you bunt foul with 2 strikes, you're out).

RC PRO AM(tm) GAME
A few more continues will always come in handy in this game--use 
PRO Codes 1 thru 4 to select the number of continues that you'd like. 
(Just one continue is always useful if you have a bunch of friends 
around!) You can also customize your car--for example, just one turbo 
pick-up could see your car with the full turbo add-on! And check out 
Code 11--it makes the computer cars go crazy . . . after half a lap or 
so . . . wait for it!

YOSHI(tm) GAME
In the tradition of great puzzle challenges like Tetris(tm) and Dr. 
Mario(tm) comes Yoshi(tm)--and Game Genie(tm) is right there! Use YOSH 
Codes 1 and 2 to change the number of eggs you need to win the two-
player game. Codes 3 thru 5 adjust the length of time you wait for 
the characters to come down from the top row, giving you more time 
to think--or less. When using Code 6, pressing 'Down' on the control 
pad freezes the characters already coming down the screen. (When 
using this feature, however, you lose the ability to speed up the fall 
of the characters.)
