DRAGON WARRIOR II(tm) GAME
Hail, warrior! Once again it is left to you to defeat the minions of 
the Dark--but nobody said it would be easy! To help you along in this 
vast quest, we've conjured up a cauldron of excellent Game 
Genie(tm) codes to adjust each character's powers.
Four different types of codes will help you--the Prince of 
Midenhall(tm)--in your quest. Three types (hit points, strength 
points and agility points) affect your own powers as well as those 
of the Prince of Cannock(tm) and Princess of Moonbrooke(tm), the 
characters you meet on your journey and then travel with. The fourth 
set of codes--for magic points--affect only the Prince of 
Cannock(tm) and the Princess.

WWF WRESTLEMANIA CHALLENGE(tm) GAME
The star code for this brawlin' game is WRES Code 1, which extends 
the normal 3-second count to 9 seconds, giving you more of a chance 
to break free from the pin. On the other hand, WRES Code 2 reduces 
the count by half, so you have to be quick and get back in the ring or 
your corner once the count starts! If your wish is to adjust all the 
timers, grant it with WRES Code 3 or 4.
