Attempt at a Go wrapper for SDL on Mac OS X
JC20101224

Current status: failure

SDL redefines the user's main to SDL_main, and implements its own
main in /usr/local/lib/libSDLmain.a which calls the user's main. This
is needed on OS X and Windows to initialize the GUI before calling user code.

With the Allegro gaming library, you have another choice: define ALLEGRO_NO_MAGIC_MAIN,
then call al_run_main() yourself, and it is no problem. SDL doesn't appear to
offer this option. On Linux the wrapping is not needed, in either library.

Neither work on OS X. They compile and link just fine (after installing the
required SDL libraries from source), but crash at runtime, after a bunch of
NSAutoreleasePool leak warnings, dying in SDL_SetVideoMode. This is because Go-SDL
neglects to run SDL's main(), so the environment is not properly setup.

To get this to work, the required initialization (implemented in SDL in
src/main/macosx/SDLMain.m, written in Objective C and using Cocoa) must be called
before any other SDL functions. It is possible to link in SDL's main():

    ar x /usr/local/lib/libSDLmain.a

then add SDLMain.o to CGO_OFILES, but gcc detects a conflict with this main()
and _cgo_export.c, so I patched SDL src/main/macosx/SDLMain.m to call it
SDL_not_main() instead of main() (not to be confused with SDL_main, which is,
confusingly, the user-defined function -- defined by the user as main() but
re#define'd as SDL_main -- that is called by the real main()). This allows it to link,
a test program using the library fails to link, with errors:

    unexpected reloc for dynamic symbol [...]

Same as on http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/218fdb0beddf2ffe/c6570053bd09c710?show_docid=c6570053bd09c710

basicsound wrapper has same problems:

Go-OpenGL also notes the need to run the code through sdlMain:
