Writing a NES Emulator
Jeff Connelly 2010/11/12

why? to learn for fun
Game Genie codes, reverse engineering, modifications to classic games

disassembler/instruction decoder
RP2A03 (6502-based) CPU simulator
other hardware
Game Genie decoder/encoder
iNES and Universal NES Interchange Format (UNIF)


language? something new to try
Go? new Google's language, compiles native, fast, systems language, improvements over C
 no existing NES emulator in Go it appears, though there is a ZX Spectrum one https://github.com/remogatto/gospeccy 
 and authors said that coding an emulator in Go was very enjoyable
Lisp? Scheme?
O'Caml? - can be compiled to bytecode/native, ML-derived language
Haskell? - team working to make work well on Mac, but not active since 2010/10 http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Mac_OS_X_Strike_Force
 existing LazyNES https://github.com/trez/LazyNES 
Objective C? - Mac only, but fast and powerful
 existing in Obj C: Maciform, last updated 2010-07-19 http://code.google.com/p/macifom/ maybe help? http://www.zophar.net/macintosh/nes.html
CoffeeScript? - nice language, compiles to JavaScript and runs in browser. limited by browser platform
 cool idea, but limited by the platform
 existing in JavaScript: JSNes http://benfirshman.com/projects/jsnes/
Prolog? - limited graphics
VHDL? Verilog? existing knes FPGA-based NES emulator https://github.com/konkers/knes
C? C++? - cliche, but possible
Python? - nice language, it is a possibility, but doesn't compile well [PyNES]
Ruby? - nice language, but not exotic enough. existing: RubyNES, 
Perl? - see perl5 ggdb.sf.net - but how about Perl 6 madness?
Java? - not my favorite

FCEUXD SP is best NES emulator for hacking purposes (with IDA Pro, $1059 http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/orderforms/namedworld.pdf)
