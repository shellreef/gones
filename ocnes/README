OcNES: A 6502 Disassembler in Objective Caml

Herein lies a simple disassembler written in OCaml for the 6502 microprocessor.
I started writing it to learn about both Objective Caml and emulation, but only
got as far as a disassembler, because:

Emulating an 8-bit CPU is cumbersome without a proper 8-bit data type in OCaml,
so I abandoned this project. Not that it would be impossible, but you'd have to
handle wraparound yourself.

I switched to the Go programming language <http://golang.org/> for this reason.
