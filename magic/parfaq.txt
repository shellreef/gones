NES Pro Action Replay FAQ           04/01/01 Jeff

Q: How rare is the NES PAR?

According to http://www.freespeech.org/smackdown/info/rare/pro/, the
NES Pro Action Replay is the rarest NES peripheral ever made.

Q: What does PAR's code format look like?

The first two hex digits specify the type, the remaining six digits are used
differently depending on the code type.

00rrrrvv    Lock RAM address RRRR to VV
01vv????    VV=value, ????=unknown (ROM modification?)
7Errrrvv    Lock RAM address RRRR to VV (not clear how this is diff from 00)

Q: Where can I find PAR codes?

http://nesworld.parodius.com/parcodes.htm has a few PAR codes, mostly for
infinite items. PAR codes are not as rare as the peripheral itself because
they are nothing more than plain RAM addresses with a value. There's also
some at my web site, http://apollo.spaceports.com/~jeff/consoles/, under
"Known memory addresses" under the game's name.

The emulators Nesten and fwNES support creation of RAM codes that you can
use on a PAR. 

Q: Can PAR modify the ROM, like Game Genie?

According to
http://www.vgstrategies.about.com/games/vgstrategies/library/misc/blgamegenie.htm
it can:

    Note: The Action Replay has the added ability to modify RAM addresses,
    in addition to ROM addresses. It accomplishes this by inserting a sub-
    routine which is activated on the "vertical blanking" interrupt of the
    screen display.

Q: How can I convert Game Genie codes to PAR codes?

Tricky, until the format for PAR ROM codes is discovered. Nonetheless, it's
possible.

Disassemble the ROM using a 6502 disassembler, such as D816. Example:

C:\>d816 foobar.nes
D816 - 65816 disassembler v1.20 - (c) 1992 The Voice Over
*cpu 6502
*hedr 10
*org 8000
*fout foobar 8000 ffff     (or higher depending on how big the PRG is)
...

Using a Game Genie decoding program, decode the GG code. You should have
an absolute address and a value. If your decoding program only gives you
a relative address, a value, and a key, better get a better program,
such as my gg.pl: http://apollo.spaceports.com/~jeff/consoles/

Find the relative address in foobar.txt. Note that it may refer to the middle
of an opcode, so try searching for the address+/-1 or 2 also. Once you find
it, look at the opcode. Let's say this is the location that is modified by
the GG code for Start With 9 Lifes:

0084F4 .. ..        LDA #$03
0084F5 .. ..        STA $ED

If you know 6502 assembly, you'll know RAM location $ED will now contain
the literal value $03. PAR's forte is RAM locations. So the code for infinite
lifes is 0000ED09.
